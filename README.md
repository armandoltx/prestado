# Prestado

How many times have you need clothes for just one occasion such as a wedding, a party or an event ad you did not have them.
Prestado is your solution either as a owner of expensive clothes that you just use once a year or as a renter who needs a tuxedo for a wedding.

Prestado is an application created by Armando Ruiz for his final project while he was attending Web Development Immersive course in General Assembly in Sydney during the winter of 2016.
